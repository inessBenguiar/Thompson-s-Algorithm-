# Thompson-s-Algorithm-
Regular Expression to NFA Converter
This Python code converts regular expressions into equivalent Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) using Thompson's construction.

Features:

-Operations: Supports * (Kleene star), + (one or more), . (concatenation), | (union).

-NFA Generation: Builds states, transitions, and Îµ-moves based on a given regular expression.
